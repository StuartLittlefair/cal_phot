    '''
lf      - Standard star reduced data in a logfile from the hipercam pipeline
mags    - [<r' magnitude>, <g' band magnitude>, <u' band magnitude>] of standard
coords  - RA and DEC of standard star, in hours and degrees, respectively.
obsname - name of observatory
ext     - optional parameter, if you want to use a different extinction coeff.


Takes a logfile containing the reduced lightcurve of a standard star, and a list of its magnitudes.
Uses the observatory and coordinates of the star to get its airmass at the start of the run, and 
assumes it's rouchly constant over the observations.

From these, calculate the instrumental magnitude of the standard, and get the correction factor, kappa,
in each band. Returns these as a list.
