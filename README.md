# cal_phot
A set of scripts that will calibrate periodic \*CAM lightcurves from counts to flux above atmosphere.

The scripts available are fairly basic calibration stuff, but this takes a lot of the legwork out of reducing periodic data. Importantly, it makes calls to SDSS, either for the comparisons in the target frame, or a separate reference star taken on the same night/run. And don't worry, these are all corrected for airmass, light travel time, etc! The overall output are a few files:
- A lightcurve for the star in aperture 1 of each supplied `.log` file
- Two figures for each lightcurve, one showing the target's flux over the observation, and another plotting the comparisons against each other
- An mcmc chain that optimises the ephemeris data

The figure containing the compared comparison stars is there to help diagnose a bad reference star. These should all ideally be flat lines at unity, but life is rarely that perfect.

The main advantage of using this script, and in writing this interpreter at all, is that it creates a consistent record of how a data set was reduced for future reference. This will reduce 'black box' complaints later, when it comes to writing up what we find in the lightcurve data.

## bin_data.py
Additionally, this git contains my binning script. This script makes an evenly spaced 1D grid of phase times, and combines the relevant data from given files into those bins. It respects errors, weights means by them, and uses the mean phase of the binned data in each bin to preserve as much information a possible.

# Using the Pipeline
This was written as a side-project, and hasn't been streamlined very much. However, there is a recommended workflow. The process is slightly different for stars in or out of the SDSS field.

## Stars in the SDSS
### 1. Reduce your raw data with the HIPERCAM pipeline
The HiPERCAM pipeline is fairly easy to use. There's great doumentation to be found [here](http://deneb.astro.warwick.ac.uk/phsaap/hipercam/docs/html/commands.html), but I'll summarise the rough steps;

- Make a flat and bias frame from the relevant runs
  - `makeflat`, `makebias`
- Make a mean frame, used to define apertures
  - `averun`
- Set the apertures that you want to extract
  - `setaper`
- Generate the reduction file
  - `genred`
- Tweak the reduction file and optimise the settings
  - (black magic)
- Reduce the data!
  - `reduce`

This produces a `.log` file, containing the electron counts per aperture, per frame. However, this still needs to be calibrated, and DOESN'T contain any pointing info. So, we need to do a lookup for some actual apparent magnitudes.


### 2. Make auxilliary files

I find it easiest to start thinking about claibration here, and later on `cal_phot` is going to want to know your comparison star magnitude. Create a new text file with the same name as your log file, and the extension `.coords`, i.e. I reduce a file and call it `star_data.log` with 2 comparison apertures, then create another file called `star_data.coords`. This file is going to contain the RA and Dec of our comparison stars, and the filter that we want the observations in. This is the general format:
```
[CCD1 filter] [CCD2 filter] [CCD3 filter] ...

[CCD1 AP1 RA] [CCD1 AP1 DEC]

[CCD2 AP1 RA] [CCD2 AP1 DEC]
[CCD2 AP2 RA] [CCD2 AP2 DEC]

[CCD3 AP3 RA] [CCD3 AP3 DEC]

...
```
Note that the whitespace is important, the apertures of the different CCDs are separated by a blank line. I find it easiest to have an `Aladin` window open on the side, where right-clicking on a star and clicking `Copy recticle position to clipboard` gives you the RA and Dec.

You should now have two files for each reduction, a `.log` and a `.coords`

### 3. Write an input file

This is the easy part. Create a raw text file, and enter the commands you want to run. They are exectured in order, so multiple instruments, or datasets, or even objects can be calibrated in one run. Though, for ease of understanding what's gone on, it's better to fragment your files. For a star in SDSS, the input is likely to look something like this:

```
# Where are we observing from?
observatory 18:35:26, +98:29:12
inst uspec

###Â Prior knowledge of the target system
coords      07:48:59.55 +31:25:12.6    # RA, Dec of target
period      0.0583110795
T0          57808.63029759

### Can we do an SDSS lookup? ###
SDSS 1

### What files contain the targets? ###
## This is a list of the best eclipses we have, for the first round of fitting. ##
logfiles    # List of logfiles to calibrate
REDUCED/uspec2017-01-22_KG5.log
REDUCED/uspec2017-02-15_KG5.log
REDUCED/uspec2017-12-12_KG5.log

## Refine our ephemeris for the system ###
getEclipseTimes     # Get eclipse timing from data files
fitEphemeris        # Fit the ecplise times for better ephemeris
   
### Process the files ###
oname       SDSSJ0748_0
combineData

### Now I want to plot my results.
# overplot [filename] [pattern]
plot    SDSSJ0748_0_KG5   _KG5
```

That looks like a lot, but fairly easy to break down. First, we tell the script where the observations it's about to process were taken from, in `lat, lon`. This allows the code to correct our observations to heliocentric time, and remove slight timing differences due to the position of the earth changing throughout the year. The code also needs to know the RA and Dec of the target, for the same reason. In a non-SDSS calibration, this will also be used to calculate and subtract airmass effects.

We tell the script what log files contain the data we're interested in. The list is terminated by a blank line.

Then, we define our existing ephemeris information *in days* before running a script to extract the eclipse times from the `.log` files we've defined as containing eclipses. Once that's done, we tell the interpreter to run the ephemeris refining tool. This fits the eclipse time to all the lightcurves it finds in the working directory, but asks for confirmation before each one.

`oname` defines an output filename template, and combinedata pulls the trigger on the final processing. The processing is interactive and should be carefully monitored, but should you doubt yourself later, a log of the reduction will be generated in `Calibration.log`. Finally, I tell `cal_phot` to `plot` the data in a `.pdf`.

### 3. Run it!
`python3 interpreter.py commandFile.dat`

## Non-SDSS Systems

These are slightly trickier, since I can't do an automatic lookup for `*CAM`-like filters. You'll have to help me out with a bit of extra legwork by *also* reducing a standard star observation on (or near) the night that the target was observed. The script is then going to take that observation, knowing the magnitude of the star, and work out the electron-count-to-flux ratio which can then be applied to the target reductions.

### 1. Reduce the target observations

This is the same as for an SDSS-field system. Just do as you would normally.

### 2. Reduce the standard star observation
The observer has likely observed a standard on the night (check the logs). Reduce this system with settings that make sense for it, but REMEMBER THOSE SETTINGS! In order to be consistent between the std. and the comparisons that we're gonna care about later, make sure you use a fixed aeperture size in the reduction! 

Then, go over to the target obeservation, and use *the exact same settings* to reduce the target frames. Use the same `.ape` file as you used in step 1, though! This will ensure consistency. I tend to call this standard-like reduction `<system_name>_standard.log`. This will be fed to the configuration file later.

### 3. Construct the configuration file

There are a few extra bits of info needed in the configuration now. The std. star will not, by definition, be in the same patch of sky as the target, and almost certainly will be viewed through a different airmass. We need to correct for this, so the software needs to know where the standard is in the sky. We also need to know the extinction at the observing site, so the following chunk needs to be added to the config `.dat`;

```
# Observing conditions
observatory lasilla
# https://www.eso.org/sci/observing/tools/Extinction.html
# http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr2/en/proj/advanced/color/sdssfilters.asp
extinction  0.08  0.161 0.52  # mags/airmass, r', g', u'
inst ucam

### Standard star information
SDSS 0                                            # Are we in the SDSS field?
stdLogfile  REDUCED/ucam/2016-08-22_std.log       # Logfile containing the standard star
stdCoords   15:51:59.89 +32:56:54.3               # RA, Dec
stdMags     10.979 10.647 10.629                  # r', g', u'

### Comparison stars, reduced with the same settings as the standard. One for each file!
comparisonLogfiles      # Ordered list of target logfiles, reduced with IDENTICAL reduction settings to the standard logfile
REDUCED/ucam/2016-08-22_comp.log
REDUCED/ucam/2016-08-23_comp.log
REDUCED/ucam/2016-08-24_comp.log
REDUCED/ucam/2016-08-25_comp.log
```

### 3. Run the interpreter

That's it! The software will walk you through the rest.
